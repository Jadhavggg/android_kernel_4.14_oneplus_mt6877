Linux kernel
============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

=================================

To build this kernel follow this guide:

https://gist.github.com/P1N2O/b9b2604c58aa4d7486e2fc0d327d23dc

Also download this gcc: https://github.com/LineageOS/android_prebuilts_gcc_linux-x86_aarch64_aarch64-linux-android-4.9

point to your GCC 

PATH="<path to clang folder>/bin:<path to gcc folder>/bin:${PATH}" \

then you can run bash oplus_native_features.sh to build =)

P.S to get Modules building you'll have to point to the directory
